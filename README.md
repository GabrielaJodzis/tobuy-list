# To-Buy List Project

This is my interpretation of a small project from the **Complete Web Developer** course. It is a simple to-buy list application where users can:

- Add items to the list
- Mark items as completed
- Delete items from the list

## Features

- **Dynamic list management:** Add and remove items in real-time.
- **Interactive design:** Mark items as done with a single click.
- **Minimalist UI:** Simple and clean interface for better user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript (DOM manipulation)**

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to practice working with JavaScript and DOM manipulation, as well as to understand basic project workflows in web development. Itâ€™s part of the journey to becoming a complete web developer.
